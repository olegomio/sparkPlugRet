SparkPlug Readme

This script automates the creation of a WordPress plugin directory and files. It simplifies the process of setting up a new plugin by generating the required structure and files based on your inputs.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the script directory.
3. Run the script using "sh sparkPlug.sh".
4. Follow the prompts and provide the requested information.
5. The script will create the plugin directory and files accordingly.


You can exit the script by typing -q, if you do so you will be prompted if you want to delete the directory or keep it.

Keep in mind, that the base plugin doesn't validate whether "retarus" or "Retarus" is prompted for the plugin name. This is important so that the directory name of the plugin doesn't have two "retarus" instances. Just copy the validation from the inital release commit.
